## Installation Process
  ### How to Build
  ```Bash
    chmod +x build_projects.sh
    ./build_projects.sh
    make
  ```

  ### How to Run
  ```Bash
    ./main
  ```
  
  ### Terminal Input To Build & Run (CopyPasta)
  ```Bash
    chmod +x build_projects.sh
    ./build_projects.sh

    ./main
  ```
  
## Usage 
  ### Getting Started 
  1) make a folder inside of **projects_folder** (*can be any name u want*)
  2) Add metadata (with proper format), main.cpp, and copy of makefile
     - *see "projects_folder/exampleProject" for reference*
  3) Make sure any added projects do not leave the scope of its own folder!
  
  ### Other Notes
  - metadata.txt: The Prefixes of each line "Project Name:", "Project Type:", is taken out when  In the metadata putting Description: delcare that line as a description and will not be shown in the meta data that appears when viewing projects

## Configuration (WIP) \[Progress Status: Not Worked On Yet\]
  ### Environment Variables:
    If your project relies on environment variables for configuration (such as database connection strings, API keys, or other sensitive information), you should document which variables need to be set and what their values should be.
    
  ### Configuration Files
    If your project uses configuration files (such as .env files, JSON files, YAML files, etc.), you can explain what settings are available in these files and how users should configure them.

  ### Command-Line Options
    If your project is a command-line tool, you might allow users to pass configuration options via command-line arguments. In this case, you can document what options are available and how to use them.
    
  ### Dependencies
    If your project depends on other services or libraries, you can mention any specific configuration requirements for those dependencies.

  ### Installation Instructions
    Sometimes, configuration steps are integrated into the installation process. If there are any configuration steps that need to be performed during installation, you should document them here.
