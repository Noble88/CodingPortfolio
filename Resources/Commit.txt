Build Debugger & Streamline Committing

- When using "./build_projects" command (used in building all project files) it will display whether the project needs files to be built or not. If they do it will show all the files that need to be build (it will check if a file has been modified or not). It will map out a heiarchy showing the location of all the .o files that will be updated/built

- Commiting to github for myself has been easier, I've made a file in Resources/Commit.txt that I write all my commit messages to. TerminalHandler has a method called UploadToGitHub() that follow these steps
  1) Check if the file is empty and offer to do a commit via the terminal (ment for small commits)
  1.1) Doing a commit via the terminal goes to the  MiniCommit() method where it will ask for a commit message
  2) if commiting via file it will read back the commit message and the ask if they are sure to commit to github

Note: this upload only works in replit and for me... I plan on making a settings file someone can put there info in

Other Fixes
- Modified makefile to actually check for files modified files before building them again.
